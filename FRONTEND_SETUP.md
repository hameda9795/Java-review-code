## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Components not found
**Error:** `Cannot find module '@/components/review/quality-score-dashboard'`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure all files are in correct locations:
ls frontend/src/components/review/
ls frontend/src/components/ui/
```

### Issue 2: Progress component missing
**Error:** `Cannot find module '@radix-ui/react-progress'`

**Solution:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install @radix-ui/react-progress
```

### Issue 3: TypeScript errors
**Error:** Type errors in component props

**Solution:**
Check that all interfaces match:
- `Finding` interface includes `metricsViolated?: string`
- `QualityScore` interface has all 5 score properties
- Review API response matches component expectations

### Issue 4: Styling not applied
**Error:** Components look unstyled

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure Tailwind is running:
npm run dev

# Check tailwind.config.js includes all component paths:
content: [
  './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
]
```
