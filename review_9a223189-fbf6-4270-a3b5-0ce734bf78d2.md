## Detailed Findings

### 1. Public mutable fields on entity

**Severity:** `CRITICAL` | **Category:** `SECURITY_VULNERABILITY` | **Status:** ❌ Unresolved

**File:** `notification/src/main/java/com/notification/notification/entity/Order.java:14`

**Description:**
The entity class 'Order' has public mutable fields which can lead to unintended modifications and data integrity issues.

**Code Snippet:**

```
public Long userId;
```

**Suggested Fix:**

```
Make fields private and provide controlled access through methods.
```

**Why This Matters:**
Public mutable fields in an entity can be directly modified from outside the class, leading to potential data corruption and security vulnerabilities. This is a critical issue as it violates encapsulation principles and can cause unpredictable behavior in a multi-threaded environment.

### 2. Entity Exposure in REST Controller

**Severity:** `HIGH` | **Category:** `CODE_SMELL` | **Status:** ❌ Unresolved

**File:** `notification/src/main/java/com/notification/notification/controller/OrderController.java:16`

**Description:**
The createOrder method returns a domain entity (Order) directly from the REST controller, which can lead to tight coupling and potential security issues.

**Code Snippet:**

```
public Order createOrder(@RequestParam Long userId) { return orderService.createOrder(userId); }
```

**Suggested Fix:**

```
Return a DTO instead of the Order entity. For example, create an OrderDTO class and map Order to OrderDTO before returning.
```

**Why This Matters:**
Returning entities directly from controllers can expose internal data structures and lead to tight coupling between the API and the database schema. This can make future changes more difficult and increase the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive data. In a hiring context, this indicates a lack of understanding of best practices in API design.

public class OrderService {
    private EmailSender emailSender = new SmtpEmailSender(); // Tight coupling

    public void processOrder() {
        emailSender.send(); // Cannot mock for testing
    }
}

// CORRECT: Dependency Injection with interface
public class OrderService {
    private final EmailSender emailSender; // Depend on abstraction

    public OrderService(EmailSender emailSender) { // Injected
        this.emailSender = emailSender;
    }

    public void processOrder() {
        emailSender.send(); // Can inject mock/stub
    }
}

// Spring wires it up:
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final EmailSender emailSender;
    // Constructor injection (recommended)
}

```

**Why This Matters:**
Dependency Inversion Principle (SOLID):
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces)

BENEFITS:
- Easy to swap implementations (SMTP -> SendGrid)
- Testable (inject mocks)
- Loose coupling
- Follows Hollywood Principle: "Don't call us, we'll call you"

SPRING BOOT BEST PRACTICE:
- Use constructor injection (not field injection)
- Depend on interfaces, not concrete classes
- Let Spring manage object lifecycle

EXCEPTION: OK to use 'new' for:
- Value objects (new Money(100))
- DTOs (new UserDto())
- Collections (new ArrayList<>())


**Impact Score:** null/10
