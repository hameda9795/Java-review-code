## Detailed Findings

### 1. Entity Exposure in REST Controller

**Severity:** `HIGH` | **Category:** `CODE_SMELL` | **Status:** ❌ Unresolved

**File:** `notification/src/main/java/com/notification/notification/controller/OrderController.java:17`

**Description:**
The Order entity is returned directly from the REST controller, which can lead to sensitive data exposure and tight coupling between the API and the database schema.

**Code Snippet:**

```
public Order createOrder(@RequestParam Long userId) { return orderService.createOrder(userId); }
```

**Suggested Fix:**

```
Return a DTO instead of the Order entity. For example, create an OrderDTO class and map the Order entity to this DTO before returning.
```

**Why This Matters:**
Exposing entities directly from REST controllers can lead to security issues if sensitive fields are accidentally exposed. It also tightly couples the API to the database schema, making future changes more difficult. This practice can lead to data leaks and maintenance challenges, which are critical concerns for employers.

**File:** `notification/src/main/java/com/notification/notification/controller/OrderController.java:16`

**Description:**
The createOrder method does not validate the userId request parameter, which could lead to invalid data being processed.

**Code Snippet:**

```
public Order createOrder(@RequestParam Long userId) {
```

**Suggested Fix:**

```
Add validation annotations such as @NotNull or custom validation logic to ensure userId is valid before processing.
```

**Why This Matters:**
Missing input validation can lead to processing invalid data, which may cause unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Employers prioritize candidates who understand the importance of validating user input to prevent such issues.

### 3. No Exception Handling in Controller

**Severity:** `MEDIUM` | **Category:** `BUG` | **Status:** ❌ Unresolved

**File:** `notification/src/main/java/com/notification/notification/controller/OrderController.java:16`

**Description:**
The createOrder method does not handle potential exceptions that may occur during order creation, such as invalid user IDs or service failures.

**Code Snippet:**

```
public Order createOrder(@RequestParam Long userId) { return orderService.createOrder(userId); }
```

**Suggested Fix:**

```
Implement exception handling using @ExceptionHandler or try-catch blocks to manage potential errors gracefully.
```

**Why This Matters:**
Lack of exception handling can lead to unhandled exceptions propagating to the client, resulting in poor user experience and potential information leakage. Employers expect candidates to write robust code that gracefully handles errors.

**Severity:** `MEDIUM` | **Category:** `BUG` | **Status:** ❌ Unresolved

**File:** `notification/src/main/java/com/notification/notification/controller/OrderController.java:17`

**Description:**
The createOrder method assumes that the orderService.createOrder method will never return null, which might not be the case.

**Code Snippet:**

```
return orderService.createOrder(userId);
```

**Suggested Fix:**

```
Add null checks or return Optional<Order> to handle potential null values safely.
```

**Why This Matters:**
NullPointerExceptions can cause application crashes and are a common source of bugs. Employers value candidates who proactively handle potential null values to ensure application stability.

### 31. Possible Dependency Inversion Violation: Using 'new' in Service

**Severity:** `MEDIUM` | **Category:** `ARCHITECTURE` | **Status:** ❌ Unresolved

**File:** `notification/src/main/java/com/notification/notification/service/OrderService.java`

**Description:**
Services should depend on abstractions (interfaces) via dependency injection, not create dependencies with 'new'.

**Suggested Fix:**

```
// WRONG: Hard-coded dependency
public class OrderService {
    private EmailSender emailSender = new SmtpEmailSender(); // Tight coupling

    public void processOrder() {
        emailSender.send(); // Cannot mock for testing
    }
}

// CORRECT: Dependency Injection with interface
public class OrderService {
    private final EmailSender emailSender; // Depend on abstraction

    public OrderService(EmailSender emailSender) { // Injected
        this.emailSender = emailSender;
    }

    public void processOrder() {
        emailSender.send(); // Can inject mock/stub
    }
}

// Spring wires it up:
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final EmailSender emailSender;
    // Constructor injection (recommended)
}

```

**Why This Matters:**
Dependency Inversion Principle (SOLID):
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces)

BENEFITS:
- Easy to swap implementations (SMTP -> SendGrid)
- Testable (inject mocks)
- Loose coupling
- Follows Hollywood Principle: "Don't call us, we'll call you"

SPRING BOOT BEST PRACTICE:
- Use constructor injection (not field injection)
- Depend on interfaces, not concrete classes
- Let Spring manage object lifecycle

EXCEPTION: OK to use 'new' for:
- Value objects (new Money(100))
- DTOs (new UserDto())
- Collections (new ArrayList<>())
